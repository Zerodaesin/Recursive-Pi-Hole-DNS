# Recursive-Pi-Hole-DNS
Adblocker and self service DNS

I wanted a dedicated ad blocker for my home network, so I decided to set up a Pi-hole.  The first consideration was hardware.  Which raspberry pi was appropriate for both the scope of the project and for my budget?  I wanted wireless capabilities because the fewer wires laying around for my dogs to chew on the better.  That ruled out most options except the 4 and the 3, with the 3 being the cheaper of the two.  The extra power and storage of the 4 was overkill for my purpose so I settled on the v3.1b+.

Software
Checking the Pi-hole documentation website, they recommended ubuntu as the OS so I installed that on my microSD card.
